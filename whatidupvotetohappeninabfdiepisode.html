            <h2>Top Upvote Ideas:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Matchcil Makeout Scene</strong> for 10 business days (purely for the drama!)</li>
                <li><strong>Pencil Lets Plays:</strong> Watch Pencil play through <em>Half-Life 2</em> and its Episodes, <em>Black Mesa</em>, <em>HL Blue Shift</em>, and <em>HL Opposing Force</em>—plus some <em>HL2DM</em> with Match and the Freesmart Alliance. The most intense BFDI gaming collab!</li>
                <li><strong>Needle</strong> finally gets over her crush on Pencil because, well, Pencil’s already taken by Match. The *ultimate* growth arc!</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Disclaimer: These are all totally serious ideas that should 100% be included in future episodes. No sarcasm. At all.</p>
