        <h1>How Expounding Could Kill Someone: The Tragic Case of John Toe</h1>
        <p>12-year-old John Toe tragically passed away after being forced to expand a friendly letter to his teacher for a major grade. For three days straight, John was made to work without adequate breaks, food, or water. When he attempted to leave the room to hydrate, he was disciplined and forced back to continue his work.</p>
        
        <p>His mother reportedly insisted he remain in the room until the task was completed. Despite repeated attempts to take short breaks, John was not allowed to stop. After several days, his mother returned to find that John had died at his desk.</p>
        
        <p>An autopsy found that John’s brain was severely overworked and his heart failed due to dehydration and exhaustion. Authorities have highlighted this case as a tragic example of the dangers of extreme academic pressure combined with lack of basic care.</p>
        
        <p>Neighbors remember John as a bright and diligent student who loved to learn. Experts warn that forcing children into prolonged work without rest or sustenance can have severe physical and mental consequences.</p>
        
        <p>This tragedy serves as a sobering reminder for parents and caregivers to balance academic expectations with basic safety and well-being.</p>
