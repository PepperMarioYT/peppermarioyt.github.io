# PepperMarioYT's Personal CLI Website

Welcome to my personal website, designed to look and function like an old-school command-line interface (CLI). This is where I share a bit about myself, my projects, and give you the opportunity to interact with my website just like you're using a terminal.

---

## Features

- **Interactive CLI**: You can type commands to interact with the site.
  - `about`: Learn more about me.
  - `projects`: Check out my personal and professional projects.
  - `contact`: Get in touch with me.
  - `clear`: Clear the terminal screen.
  - `help`: List all available commands.

- **Customizable**: Feel free to add more commands and features as needed.
