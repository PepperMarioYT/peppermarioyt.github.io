    <h1>How Tariffs Affect BFDI Merchandise (unofficial note)</h1>
    <h2>Attention, American Fans!</h2>
    <p>Recent tariff changes have increased the cost of importing goods from various countries, including China. Since many <a href="https://shop.jacknjellify.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BFDI</a> merchandise items are produced overseas, these tariffs may lead to higher prices for your favorite plushies and collectibles.</p>
